# Advanced-Modeling (Machine Learning)

## Theory
We made the decision or predict replying on our own experience. For example, when we see the clear blue sky after it rained we can predict it will be sunny tomorrow. How did we know? Because we've already experienced it and depending on that we can do the prediction. Likewise, by using machine learning algorithm we can make the model for the prediction using the data which is the experience for human prediction. 

Apart from the data, we need some results to make the model and we call this as labels. If our prediction has the binary results then we call this **classification**. <br/>
If the result is continuous value then we call this **regression**.
